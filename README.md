**Project Name:** Basic Laravel Task List

**Overview:**
The Basic Laravel Task List is a simple yet efficient task management application built using Laravel. It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks seamlessly. The main home page displays all tasks, with completed tasks visibly marked. Pagination facilitates easy navigation through tasks, while a task counter keeps users informed about the total number of tasks and the current view.

**Technologies Used:**
-Laravel
-Blade template engine
-Tailwind CSS
-Alpine.js
-Hosting: SiteGround

**Your Role:**
As a personal project, I handled all aspects of development independently.

**Key Features:**

**Task Management:** 
Users can add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
Visual Indicators: Completed tasks are visibly distinguished, enhancing user experience.
Pagination: Easy navigation through tasks with pagination controls.
Task Counter: Displays the total number of tasks and the current view for user convenience.
Challenges Faced:

Blade Template Understanding: Initial challenges understanding the Blade template engine and its syntax.
Project Setup: Setting up and initiating a Laravel project, especially as it was my first project in Laravel.

**Future Plans:**
In the future, I aim to enhance the application's functionality by introducing user authentication and making it user-specific. This will involve segregating tasks so that each user sees and manages only their tasks, ensuring a more personalized user experience.
